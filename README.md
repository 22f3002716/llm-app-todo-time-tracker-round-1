# To-Do Tracker

A simple, responsive single-page To-Do application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add, delete, edit, and mark tasks as complete, with all changes persisting in the browser's local storage.

## Features

*   **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks to your list using the input field.
*   **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need with a dedicated delete button.
*   **Edit Tasks**: Click on any task's text to transform it into an editable input field. Modify the text and press Enter or click outside to save your changes.
*   **Track Completion**: Each task comes with a checkbox. Mark tasks as complete, and they will be visually distinguished (e.g., strikethrough). Uncheck to mark them as incomplete.
*   **Persistence**: All your tasks and their completion status are automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so your list remains intact even after closing and reopening the browser.
*   **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work well across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

## How to Run

1.  **Save the files**: Ensure `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` are in the same directory.
2.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3.  **Start tracking!**:
    *   Type a task into the input box and click "Add Task" or press Enter.
    *   Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete/incomplete.
    *   Click the task text to edit it, then press Enter or click away to save.
    *   Click the "âœ–" button to delete a task.
